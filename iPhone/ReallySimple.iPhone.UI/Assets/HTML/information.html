<h2>How does it work?</h2>
<p>
Really Simple takes RSS feeds from various quality news sources and displays them in an easy to read way, optimised for the 
iPhone/iTouch. The design and type is intended to be as easy on the eyes as printed text - the colour combinations 
are chosen for this.
</p>

<h2>Do I need an internet connection to read the news?</h2>
<p>
You will need to be connected to update or get the initial feeds. Once this is done (it takes around 15-20 seconds on 3G) 
you can read all the news offline, and images will be available offline as well.
</p>

<h2>How can I add more feeds?</h2>
<p>
The feed sources are chosen for you with Really Simple. If you want to get updates of your own favourite feeds, then a feed 
reader such as Google's, Yahoo's, or the many on the Appstore is better suited for this task.
</p>

<h2>I only see English language feeds</h2>
<p>
Future versions of the app will have news sources based on your app store location. For now, the feeds are US and UK based.
</p>

<h2>How is the content retrieved?</h2>
The feed sources are updated periodically during the day on our servers. You then receive these feeds on your device 
every so often, in a very fast and compact format (unlike the RSS format). You only ever download the latest news items to your device.</p>

<h2>Are there any social aspects to the app?</h2>
<p>Twitter, email and facebook integration is planned for future versions of the app.</p>

<h2>How do I suggest a feed, send feedback, or get angry at you?</h2>
<p>
Please send all feedback to <a href="mailto:feedback@rlysimple.com">feedback@rlysimple.com</a>.<br/>
Please send all support releated issues to <a href="support@rlysimple.com">support@rlysimple.com</a>
</p>

<h2>Did you misspell your domain name?</h2>
<p>
rlysimple.com was chosen because, as you probably guessed, reallysimple.com was being cybersquated. 
RSS is an acronym for <b>Really Simple</b> Syndication.
</p>

<h1>Troubleshooting</h1>
<p>
<h2>The app says "Getting latest feeds" and does nothing</h2>
Please check your internet connection isn't flakey before getting the latest feeds (wifi is recommended if you want images 
as well). If you are using 3G or Edge then try increasing the time out in the settings. Also ensure that your device is 
not connected via USB to your Mac or PC as this can cause issues.
</p>

<h2>I choose a category and it says "There are no new items available right now."</h2>
<p>
This can be because of one of three reasons:
</p>
<ol>
	<li>Your settings has "hide read items" set, and you have read all the items for the category you have chosen.</li>
	<li>You haven't updated before, and you internet connection is slow/flakey so Really Simple wasn't able to update the feeds.</li>
	<li>You've updated, but the category or categories really don't have any new news items! This is unlikely to happen frequently however.</li>
</ol>


<h2>Download images is on, but I don't see any images</h2>
<p>
The first few images for the categories you have chosen are initially downloaded when the feeds are updated. The remaining 
are images are then downloaded in the background (the pulser denotes this on the toolbar). If you do not see any images, 
give the app a few minutes to finish downloading the images and then they will appear.
</p>

<h2>Some of the images are stretched and distorted</h2>
<p>Unfortunately not all the feeds have thumbnail images designed for mobile device - a few use images that are small. Future versions 
of the app will cater for this.
