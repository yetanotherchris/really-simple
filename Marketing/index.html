	<h1>Information</h1>
	<p>
	Really Simple takes RSS feeds from various quality news sources and displays them in an easy to read way, optimised for the 
	iPhone/iTouch. The design and type is intended to be as easy on the eye as printed text.
	</p>

	<p>
	Really Simple saves all the news feeds and images for reading offline. You can pick a selection of 8 different categories, each source  
	is periodically updated throughout the day.
	</p>

		<img src="images/screenshots/2_small.png" />
		<img src="images/screenshots/3_small.png" />
		<img src="images/screenshots/4_small.png" />
	</div>

	<h1>Troubleshooting</h1>
	
	<h3>How do I suggest a feed, send feedback, or get angry at you?</h3>
	<p>Please read this section before sending a support request.</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Feedback: <a href="mailto:feedback@rlysimple.com">feedback@rlysimple.com</a></li>
		<li>Support releated issues: <a href="support@rlysimple.com">support@rlysimple.com</a></li>
	</ul>

	<h3>The app says "Getting latest feeds" and then does nothing</h3>
	<p>
	Please check your internet connection isn't slow/flakey before getting the latest feeds (WIFI is recommended if you want images 
	as well). If you are using 3G or Edge then try increasing the time out in the settings. Also ensure that your device is 
	not connected via USB to your Mac or PC as this can cause issues.
	</p>

	<h3>I choose a category and it says "There are no new items available right now."</h3>
	<p>
	This can be because of one of three reasons:
	</p>
	<ol>
		<li>Your settings have &quot;hide read items&quot; set, and you have read all the items for the categories you have chosen.</li>
		<li>You haven't updated before, and your internet connection is slow/flakey so Really Simple wasn't able to update the feeds.</li>
		<li>You've updated, but the categories really don&#39;t have any new news items! This will very rarely happen however.</li>
	</ol>


	<h3>Download images is enabled, but I don't see any images</h3>
	<p>
	The first few images for the categories you have chosen are initially downloaded when the feeds are updated. The remaining 
	images are then downloaded in the background (the pulser denotes this on the toolbar). If you do not see any images, 
	give the app a few minutes to finish downloading the images and then they will appear.
	</p>

	<h3>Some of the images are stretched and distorted</h3>
	<p>Unfortunately not all the feeds have thumbnail images designed for mobile device - a few use images that are small. Future versions 
	of the app will cater for this.</p>
